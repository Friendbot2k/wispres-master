                <h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>
                <br><br>

                This Statement of Rights and Responsibilities ("Statement," "Terms," or "SRR") derives from the The Wisdom Preserve Principles, and is our terms of service that governs our relationship with users and others who interact with The Wisdom Preserve, as well as The Wisdom Preserve brands, products and services, which we call the “The Wisdom Preserve Services” or “Services”. By using or accessing the The Wisdom Preserve, you agree to this Statement, as updated from time to time in accordance with Section 13 below. Additionally, you will find resources in the About Us that help you understand how The Wisdom Preserve works. <br><br>

                Because The Wisdom Preserve provides a wide range of Services, we may ask you to review and accept supplemental terms that apply to your interaction with a specific app, product, or service. To the extent those supplemental terms conflict with this SRR, the supplemental terms associated with the product or service govern with respect to your use of such app, product or service to the extent of the conflict. <br><br>
                1.  Privacy<br><br>

                Your privacy is very important to us. We designed our Data Policy to make important disclosures about how you can use The Wisdom Preserve to share with others and how we collect and can use your content and information. We encourage you to read the Data Policy, and to use it to help you make informed decisions. <br><br>
                 
                2.  Sharing Your Content and Information<br><br>

                Once a writer to The Wisdom Preserve submits information to us, they should assume that they no longer own the content and information as it is intended to be made available to the public on an ongoing basis. In addition: <br><br>
                1.  For content that is covered by intellectual property rights, like photos and videos (IP content), you specifically give us the following permission: you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any IP content that you post on or in connection with The Wisdom Preserve (IP License). This IP License ends when you delete your IP content or your account unless your content has been shared with others, and they have not deleted it. <br><br>
                2.  When you delete IP content, it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the recycle bin on a computer. However, you understand that removed content may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time (but will not be available to others).<br><br>
                3.  When you publish content or information on The Wisdom Preserve, it means that you are allowing everyone, including people off of The Wisdom Preserve, to access and use that information, and to associate it with you (i.e., your name and profile picture).<br><br>
                4.  We always appreciate your feedback or other suggestions about The Wisdom Preserve, but you understand that we may use your feedback or suggestions without any obligation to compensate you for them (just as you have no obligation to offer them).<br><br>
                 
                3.  Safety our writers and readers<br><br>
